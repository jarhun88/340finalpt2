Machine Learning Models for the autonomous driving prediction problem.

There are two models in this project. KNN and MLP.

To run KNN model, open the terminal and at the project root directory run the following commands in order:

1. python runKnn.py -q csv

2. python runKnn.py -q knn

To run MLP model, open the terminal and at the project root directory run the command:

python main.py
